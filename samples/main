# uberforeman setup sample file. This sample show a setup of 2 hosts
# 1. database host 
# 2. web server host - it requires running database for all webapps to start-up correctly
# This setup will install database host first, then install web server. We will
# pass a parameter to web server installation so it knows IP address of database server.
